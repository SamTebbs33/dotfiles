# vim-phpcolors

VIM color schemes for PHP. Best used with the improved PHP syntax highlight plugin [vim.php](https://github.com/StanAngeloff/php.vim) and the plugin for better phpdoc support [phpDocumentor](https://github.com/vim-scripts/PDV--phpDocumentor-for-Vim). These are used in the screenshots.

## Installation
The manual way is just to put the theme files into your `.vim/colors/` directory, either download them or clone with git.

Then add this to your `.vimrc`
```viml
colorscheme <name of the scheme>
```
